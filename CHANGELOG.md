The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`stride-completing-tasks` skill** — Surfaced `explorer_result` and `reviewer_result` in six places so agents cannot forget them: (1) the MANDATORY teaser at the top of the skill lists both as required alongside the hook results; (2) the pre-completion Verification Checklist asks whether both are included; (3) the primary API Request Format example includes both in the self-reported skip shape (Codex's weaker custom-agent support makes skip the primary path); (4) a new "Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema" section leads with the skip shape, then documents the dispatched shape, the five-value skip-reason enum (`no_subagent_support`, `small_task_0_1_key_files`, `trivial_change_docs_only`, `self_reported_exploration`, `self_reported_review`), the 40-character non-whitespace summary minimum, a 422 rejection example, and the feature-flag grace-period rollout; (5) the Completion Request Field Reference table lists both as required objects; (6) the Quick Reference Card's `REQUIRED BODY` includes both plus a SKIP FORM snippet.
- **`stride-workflow` skill** — Step 8's Required Fields table and JSON payload example now include `explorer_result` and `reviewer_result` using the skip shape as the default. A new "Explorer and Reviewer Result Rollout" section after "Workflow Telemetry" describes the grace-mode/strict-mode feature-flag phases and directs readers to `stride-completing-tasks` for the full shape (no schema duplication). Orchestrator prose explains that Steps 3 and 6 already produce the data needed to populate these fields in Step 8, and that the skip form is the default path on Codex.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **`stride-workflow` skill** — New "Workflow Telemetry: The `workflow_steps` Array" section documenting the six-entry step-name vocabulary (`explorer`, `planner`, `implementation`, `reviewer`, `after_doing`, `before_review`), per-step schema (`name`, `dispatched`, `duration_ms`, `reason`), full-dispatch and skipped-step examples, and rules for assembling the array. Step names are identical to the main stride plugin so Stride can aggregate telemetry across agents and plugins.
- **`stride-completing-tasks` skill** — `workflow_steps` now appears in the verification checklist, the API Request Format example, the Completion Request Field Reference table, and the Quick Reference Card REQUIRED BODY. Added a Schema Reference paragraph pointing at `stride-workflow` as the source of truth for the array shape.

### Changed

- **`stride-completing-tasks` skill** — "Critical" note under the payload example now lists `workflow_steps` alongside the two hook-result fields as required. The API will reject completions that omit it.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **`stride-claiming-tasks`** — Replaced soft "Recommended" orchestrator section with non-negotiable "YOUR NEXT STEP" gate demanding stride-workflow activation immediately after claiming. Added workflow violation warning to standalone mode.
- **`stride-completing-tasks`** — Added "BEFORE CALLING COMPLETE: Verification Checklist" with 4 yes/no items covering orchestrator activation, codebase exploration, acceptance criteria review, and hook readiness.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **`stride-workflow` skill** — Single orchestrator for the complete Stride task lifecycle adapted for Codex CLI. Walks through prerequisites, claiming, codebase exploration (via custom agents with graceful fallback), implementation, code review, manual hook execution, and completion in a single skill. Uses process-over-speed messaging. Eliminates the need to remember which skills to activate at which moments.

### Changed

- **`stride-claiming-tasks` skill** — Reframed automation notice from throughput-emphasizing ("FULLY AUTOMATED") to process-over-speed ("The workflow IS the automation"). Added "Recommended: Use the Workflow Orchestrator" section pointing to `stride-workflow`. Renamed "MANDATORY: Next Skill After Claiming" to "Next Skill After Claiming (Standalone Mode)".
- **`stride-completing-tasks` skill** — Reframed automation notice from throughput-emphasizing to process-over-speed. Added "Arriving from stride-workflow" section. Renamed "MANDATORY: Previous Skill Before Completing" to "Previous Skill Before Completing (Standalone Mode)". Added `stride-workflow` as first entry in the prerequisite skills list.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Updated Workflow Sequence to recommend `stride-workflow` as preferred entry point, with standalone skill chain as alternative.
- **`README.md`** — Added `stride-workflow` to Workflow Order (as recommended) and Skills table. Existing standalone workflow preserved as alternative.
